<h2>About Me</h2>
</header>

<section>
    <p>My decision to take this web design course was rather straightforward. In the process of earning an IT tech degree, I have always been someone to tinker with the hardware and software of different devices in hopes of repairing them or granting them new features. In spite of learning a lot more technical knowledge about computers, I still use pre-made web site building tools that I would have used as a novice. Considering that my first technology to tinker around with was often checking the different elements of HTML web pages using developer tools in my browser, I felt it was a worthwhile endeavor to actually learn how to build websites and use web coding languages.<br>
    I was able to develop skills that I am thankful to have, especially as this class encouraged me to put time aside to study and learn all of these skills. Something that I don't think I realistically would have accomplished given how busy this year has been. In fact, I would even find myself going into rabbit holes of research about specific elements, ways I could potentially improve my code only to have to pull myself back into completing admittedly very straightforward assignments.<br>
    Below you will find web pages that are able to communicate some of the content that I learned over the course of this semester's class.<br> 
    Enjoy!<br>
